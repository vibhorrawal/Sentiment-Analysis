# Sentiment-Analysis
Use *main.py* to run your query.
You first have to use the virtual environment *env*.
<br>
Run:
`source env/bin/activate` in root directory.
<br>
or
you can install requirements by running
<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
<br>
For checking sentiments pertaining to a given topic or a hashtag or even a user on **Twitter**, you can use any query. eg- *#Avengers*, *@twitter* or even *'Europe elections'*
<br>	To run *<your-query>* :

`python main.py -q "<your-query>"`
